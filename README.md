it's a work in progress so don't expect it to be bug free yet. 
I just started. I am eventually going to put every single Monster in D&D 3.5 in this game. if it takes me another 40 years I'm going to do it. I'm also going to include a bunch of other stuff for combat and cities. the point of this is to be able to interact with miniatures. I'm sure they'll think of some interesting features. if you have any suggestions drop me a line at screennameplus1@gmail.com. I will probably definitely add them.
this is based on D&D 3.5 and it is set in the Feywild.
Here's a description of the Feywild text-based RPG 
we've been building: 
Feywild: A Text-Based Adventure "Feywild" 
is a text-based RPG set in the vibrant, yet perilous, realm of 
the Feywild, the land above the shadowy Underdark. Players take

the plant life of this magical realm, who is thrust into a 
desperate struggle for survival.Setting: The game unfolds in a 
lush, ancient grove, a sanctuary on the edge of the Feywild, 
bordering the sinister influence of the Underdark. 
This once-peaceful haven is shattered by a sudden, brutal 
invasion by corrupted Drow forces, their minds and bodies 
twisted by a dark, otherworldly energy. The Feywild's natural 
beauty is rapidly succumbing to this encroaching corruption, 
turning it into a twisted reflection of its former self.
Gameplay:
Players navigate the Feywild using text commands, exploring 
locations described in vivid detail. They'll encounter a variety

mana, to overcome their foes.
